I feel you really gotta follow the directions, you have to go to the app delegate swift and print the funcs that you have on the top and after you print put app delegate each one. Then go to the view controller and do the override funcs that you created, and put super. the view whatever you called it, then print it, that is for each one so how many funcs you typed you do that for each step. Then you go the main storyboard and create a button then pin it to be horizontally and vertically and then get a navigation controller and then run it.
